- Follow Clean Architecture layers:
  - **Domain**: pure business rules.
  - **Application / Use-Cases**: orchestrates domain objects via ports.
  - **Interface Adapters**: controllers, presenters, views.
  - **Infrastructure / Frameworks**: DB, HTTP, OS specifics.
- Dependencies flow inward; outer layers depend on inner layers only.
- Keep bounded contexts (library management, auth, streaming, VR) separate.
- Expose behaviour via Hexagonal **Ports & Adapters**.
- Services should be stateless; persist state in DB or filesystem.
